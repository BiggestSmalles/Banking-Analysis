## üè¶ Bank Loan Report Analysis

Welcome to the **Bank Loan Analysis** project! This repository contains my detailed analysis of bank loan data aimed at uncovering key insights into loan applications, funding, repayment behaviors, and more. This project demonstrates my expertise in data analysis, SQL, and data visualization more specifically using Tableau Public, and providing valuable insights that can aid in strategic decision-making. Here's also my Tablau Public link: https://public.tableau.com/shared/HZKZCD3QT?:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

## üìä Project Overview

This project explores a dataset of **38,576 bank loan applications**, with a focus on answering critical questions related to loan performance, interest rates, and borrower behavior. The analysis covers various dimensions, including loan status, geographical distribution, and borrower characteristics.

### Key Questions Addressed
- **Loan Volume and Funding:**
  - How many loans were applied for, funded, and fully repaid?
  - Breakdown of monthly trends and overall loan performance.

- **Interest Rate Analysis:**
  - What is the average interest rate across all loans?
  - How do interest rates vary by loan status?

- **Loan Performance:**
  - What percentage of loans are considered "good" (fully paid or current) versus "bad" (charged off)?
  - Analysis of funding and repayment for both "good" and "bad" loans.

- **Geographical and Purpose-based Insights:**
  - Which states have the highest loan applications and funding?
  - Common purposes for loans and their respective performance.

## üìà Data Summary

- **Total Loan Applications:** 38.6k
- **Average Interest Rate:** 12.0%
- **Good Loan Percentage:** 86.2%
- **Bad Loan Percentage:** 13.8%
- **Total Funded Amount:** \$435.8M
- **Total Amount Received:** \$473.1M

## üõ† Technical Details

My analysis leverages the following tools and technologies:

- **SQL:** SQL was used extensively to query and aggregate the data, providing deep insights into the bank's loan portfolio.
- **Tableau:** Interactive dashboards were created in Tableau to visualize the data, making it easier to explore and interpret key trends and metrics.

## üìä Visualizations
The project includes interactive visualizations created in Tableau. These dashboards allow for in-depth exploration of:

- Loan Application Trends by Month
- Geographical Distribution of Loans
- Loan Purpose and Performance
- Loan Term and Employee Length Analysis
